Modeling and Simulation in Python Project 1 Fall 2017. 
# Our Project
- We're studying the impact of wolf reintroduction in yellowstone on elk populations. Wolves were reintroduced in 1995, so we need information from before and after this year. 
- Wolves in yellowstone were systematically killed until about 1926 - from then until they were reintroduced in 1995, there were essentially no wolves in yellowstone. The data we use specifcally is aggregated on this site, 
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_wolves_in_Yellowstone#cite_note-6.
- Note that the actual data comes from the superintendent's bureau and the yellowstone wolf preservation group. 
- We also need data on elk populations so that we can look at connections. We got this data from the National Park Services website. 
- By forming this model of what the wolf reintroduction did to the elk populations, we can answer questions about whether it would be appropriate to control the wolf population more strictly, continue to condone the legal hunting of wolves in the greater yellowstone area, etc.
