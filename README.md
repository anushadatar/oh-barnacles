# Oh, Barnacles
Modeling and Simulation in Python (Olin College Fall 2017) project 1 code and documentation.

# Summary
The purpose of this project was to focus on a case study in population dynamics and work to use data to learn about and try to solve some interesting problem in this domain. We decided to study wolf and elk populations in Yellowstone National Park; the reason this problem is interesting is because wolves were originally all killed in the park, and then they were reintroduced fairly suddenly. Meanwhile, the elk population is actively threatened by the existence of wolves. In addition to the code for our mathematical model, this repository also include a quad chart of our findings in PDF form.
